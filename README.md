# Weekend-Redux-Feedback-Loop

## Description

    Duration: 10 hours

This project is a form intended to provide feedback to the administrator. This project was really enjoyable. I decided to pass info to only one reducer by sending an object that got spread in the redux reducer. I think this made the process much easier as I could cut and past my page info to the next page. This also simplified the styling. Were I to do this again I would have sketched out my styling before writing the html frames.


### Prerequisites

Link to software that is required to install the app (e.g. node).

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

<!-- is this what your looking for? ⤴️  or should I list all the other installs (i.e. express, bodyparser, router, redux etc.-->


## Installation


1. Create a database named `prime_feedback`,
2. The queries in the `data.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
